# Graph-Algorithms

A **Graph Algorithm** is a set of computational steps used to solve problems related to graphs, which consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections). These algorithms are used to explore graphs, find shortest paths, detect cycles, build minimum spanning trees, and analyze connectivity. Common applications include networking, routing, social networks, and scheduling problems.



**BFS**
---------------------------------------------------------
Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that starts from a source node and explores the graph level by level. First, it visits all nodes directly adjacent to the source. Then, it moves on to visit the adjacent nodes of those nodes, and this process continues until all reachable nodes are visited.
