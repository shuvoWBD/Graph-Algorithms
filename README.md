# Graph-Algorithms

A **Graph Algorithm** is a set of computational steps used to solve problems related to graphs, which consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections). These algorithms are used to explore graphs, find shortest paths, detect cycles, build minimum spanning trees, and analyze connectivity. Common applications include networking, routing, social networks, and scheduling problems.
